## Introduction
Rainfall prediction is crucial for various sectors, such as agriculture, water resource management, and weather forecasting. This project implements machine learning models to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The models are trained using various meteorological features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

## Features
- Data pre-processing and cleaning of weather datasets.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for feature understanding.
- Implementation of different machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) for rainfall prediction.
- Model evaluation and comparison using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical weather data, including:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind speed
- Atmospheric pressure
- Rainfall levels

## Model
The project uses various machine learning models, including:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple, interpretable model for predicting continuous values.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble model that handles non-linear relationships and interactions.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A powerful boosting algorithm that works well with structured data.

Each model is evaluated using standard metrics to compare performance.

## Results
Here are the results from different models (you can update this after running the notebook):
- **Linear Regression**: MSE = 120.5, R¬≤ = 0.82
- **Random Forest**: MSE = 100.3, R¬≤ = 0.88
- **Gradient Boosting**: MSE = 95.7, R¬≤ = 0.90

You can find detailed evaluation results in the notebook.
